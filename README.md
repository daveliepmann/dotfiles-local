dotfiles-local
==============

My emacs configuration piggybacks on [Jack Rusher's dotfiles
configuration](https://github.com/jackrusher/dotfiles), which does the
real heavy lifting. (His dotemacs.el allows for a <username>-local.el
to supplement itself.)

My primary concern is preserving keyboard navigation. (Nobody puts
`M-<arrow>` in a corner.) This is also a playground for minor preferences
and fiddling with packages (e.g. Processing-mode). Bifurcating the
configuration is useful as it gives me the power of his frequent and
useful updates along with freedom to monkey as I please.
