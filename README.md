dotfiles-local
==============

My emacs configuration piggybacks on [Jack Rusher's dotfiles
configuration](https://github.com/jackrusher/dotfiles), which does the
real heavy lifting. His `dotemacs.el` allows for a `[username]-local.el`
as a separate emacs config sandbox.

As with any emacs config, my primary concerns are preserving keyboard
navigation (nobody puts `M-<arrow>` in a corner) and fiddling with
packages (e.g. [Processing-mode](
https://github.com/ptrv/processing2-emacs)). Bifurcating the
configuration is useful because it gives me the power of his frequent
updates along with freedom to monkey as I please.
